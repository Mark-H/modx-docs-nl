## About this Repository
Thus repository contains a work in progress documentation source. While only loosely organized at this point, we will hopefully see this repository gain strenght and structure as times go by and contributors hop aboard. This repo will hopefully power a less technical front end view at some point 

## For contributors

Be consice, but spoil the reader with little "nice to knows" and make sure that the docs make sense to people with no experience whatsoever with the subject. If not possible, provide ample links to resources that can help them get to the required state.

Quality is more important than quantity.
At this point of the progress, getting started tutorials are more important than advanced API references. 
Dutchies are typically fairly good at English, so don't hesitate pointing to other English sources.

Theres no code style or suggested templates yet, discussion on standards like this would be great in the issues sections!
